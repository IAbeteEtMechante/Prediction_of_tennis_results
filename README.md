This repository is an attempt to predict tennis games result based on the interview given just before the game.
We preprocess the interview text to keep only the answers of one player about the current game, and try to use that to predict the result of the game.

We are very interested in the approach followed in this article:

We tried to reproduce and analyse their results, and worked on the dataset they provided:

Special thanks to Ahmed who helped us build the streamlit app.
His explanations on how to make a streamlit app are very informative:
