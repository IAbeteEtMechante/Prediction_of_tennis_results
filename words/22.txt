i
feel
good
i
am
well
prepared
for
this
match
and
most
importantly
i
am
healthy
my
expectations
are
that
i
will
be
able
to
win
and
achieve
my
first
triumph
in
the
largest
mixed
martial
arts
organization
the
ufc
what
i
can
say
about
ben
rottwell
is
that
he
is
one
of
the
most
experienced
fighters
in
the
ufc
heavyweight
division
he
has
been
competing
in
the
organization
for
almost
years
he
has
victories
over
really
quite
serious
names
he
has
defeated
the
legend
mark
hunt
he
has
knocked
out
alistair
overim
in
addition
to
serious
experience
he
is
physically
healthy
able
to
lock
his
opponents
in
various
ways
and
change
three
guards
during
combat
the
big
downside
for
him
now
is
that
he
has
nt
climbed
the
octagon
in
almost
years
and
i
think
that
will
tip
things
in
my
favor
