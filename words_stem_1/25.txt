i
am
happi
to
be
abl
to
particip
in
such
a
larg
organ
as
asa
but
my
excit
remain
the
same
as
befor
ani
other
struggl
in
my
opinion
their
assess
is
due
to
the
fact
that
stru
is
on
home
soil
but
onli
he
and
i
will
be
in
the
cage
the
judg
and
the
struggl
between
us
moreov
in
thi
sport
one
stroke
can
solv
everyth
and
it
is
veri
difficult
to
determin
in
advanc
who
will
be
the
winner
which
mean
that
it
is
not
possibl
to
determin
who
is
the
favorit
and
who
is
not
we
have
the
same
experi
in
mix
martial
art
and
almost
ident
physic
paramet
so
i
m
not
bother
by
the
option
as
well
as
the
past
late
he
fight
more
often
as
a
guest
than
as
a
host
so
it
doe
nt
matter
to
me
i
think
stru
is
certainli
a
strong
oppon
but
not
invinc
i
want
to
prove
it
in
battl
my
train
befor
the
match
is
go
well
and
now
i
feel
great
if
there
are
other
offer
from
asa
i
will
continu
to
play
in
thi
leagu
but
i
intend
to
develop
my
career
in
other
chain
as
well
time
will
tell
