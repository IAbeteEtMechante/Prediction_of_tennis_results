i
had
good
matches
but
i
also
missed
opportunities
i
had
nt
trained
very
well
in
a
few
months
i
had
hesitations
with
the
team
and
i
was
distracted
i
did
not
have
this
preparation
to
finish
well
i
ve
played
well
in
the
last
few
tournaments
and
i
m
happy
with
that
it
was
important
that
the
season
passed
without
injuries
i
ve
been
training
for
the
last
few
weeks
everyone
does
their
job
in
my
team
but
we
need
time
to
adjust
to
the
situation
i
never
wanted
to
rush
to
choose
a
coach
i
had
to
give
myself
time
we
met
with
franco
several
times
to
talk
about
how
to
play
and
we
decided
to
give
it
a
try
i
felt
after
the
first
few
days
that
he
was
a
good
choice
for
me
not
only
as
a
coach
but
he
is
also
a
good
person
i
look
at
our
cooperation
for
a
long
time
for
now
everything
is
going
according
to
plan
i
had
a
lot
of
requirements
for
the
coach
let
s
hope
it
s
the
last
one
i
have
to
choose
i
also
had
problems
with
the
rocket
i
do
nt
want
that
to
sound
like
an
excuse
i
do
not
regret
any
of
the
decisions
i
have
made
i
take
responsibility
for
everything
i
have
done
one
day
you
are
8th
the
next
day
you
are
28th
this
is
a
good
lesson
for
me
we
are
working
on
several
elements
service
return
more
work
is
needed
there
are
subtleties
in
the
game
but
it
takes
time
things
do
nt
happen
all
of
a
sudden
my
rocket
is
ready
in
a
week
i
will
finally
finish
everything
with
her
i
m
very
excited
i
m
used
to
her
in
general
but
she
needs
more
matches
all
the
people
who
will
come
to
the
hall
are
very
important
to
me
my
family
the
dimitar
berbatov
foundation
i
was
one
of
the
first
winners
and
i
ca
nt
forget
that
i
want
to
give
something
back
i
want
to
thank
them
the
goal
is
not
just
to
make
a
show
but
to
play
a
good
match
i
have
always
wanted
to
play
in
bulgaria
in
front
of
a
native
audience
very
excited
however
i
want
to
have
someone
who
contributes
to
the
atmosphere
itself
we
know
each
other
he
has
a
good
arsenal
of
hotshots
we
hope
you
all
be
there
with
us
gael
is
a
very
colorful
player
serves
well
moves
well
on
the
court
we
played
a
game
some
time
ago
and
he
told
me
you
know
how
i
play
i
try
to
beat
everyone
in
the
first
few
games
then
i
just
score
the
ball
it
s
hard
to
play
against
him
at
roland
garros
it
s
like
facing
the
whole
country
