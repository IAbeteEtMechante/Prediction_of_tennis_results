this
is
something
big
not
only
for
me
but
for
the
whole
of
bulgaria
my
homeland
it
is
amazing
to
be
able
to
show
that
anything
is
possible
you
cross
boundaries
no
matter
where
you
come
from
everything
depends
only
on
you
and
everything
is
in
your
hands
people
need
to
understand
that
when
you
set
a
goal
in
your
mind
and
work
hard
for
it
every
day
and
cross
those
boundaries
your
limit
is
only
the
sky
you
can
dream
every
day

made
an
exceptional
end
to
the
season
in
which
he
relied
on
great
selfconfidence
and
inertia
