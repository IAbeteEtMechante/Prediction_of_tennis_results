i
am
happy
to
be
able
to
participate
in
such
a
large
organization
as
asa
but
my
excitement
remains
the
same
as
before
any
other
struggle
in
my
opinion
their
assessment
is
due
to
the
fact
that
strus
is
on
home
soil
but
only
he
and
i
will
be
in
the
cage
the
judges
and
the
struggle
between
us
moreover
in
this
sport
one
stroke
can
solve
everything
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
determine
in
advance
who
will
be
the
winner
which
means
that
it
is
not
possible
to
determine
who
is
the
favorite
and
who
is
not
we
have
the
same
experience
in
mixed
martial
arts
and
almost
identical
physical
parameters
so
i
m
not
bothered
by
the
options
as
well
as
the
past
lately
he
fights
more
often
as
a
guest
than
as
a
host
so
it
does
nt
matter
to
me
i
think
strus
is
certainly
a
strong
opponent
but
not
invincible
i
want
to
prove
it
in
battle
my
training
before
the
match
is
going
well
and
now
i
feel
great
if
there
are
other
offers
from
asa
i
will
continue
to
play
in
this
league
but
i
intend
to
develop
my
career
in
other
chains
as
well
time
will
tell
