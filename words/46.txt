every
time
we
play
grigor
is
even
stronger
than
the
last
time
he
is
at
the
perfect
age
develops
his
game
in
the
best
way
is
very
physically
healthy
and
took
the
next
step
psychologically
we
could
also
play
with
him
at
the
australian
open
in
melbourne
when
he
was
close
to
victory
against
rafa
nadal
i
expect
a
very
difficult
match
it
will
be
exciting
grigor
makes
great
shots
i
had
more
problems
with
the
common
cold
than
with
my
rivals
