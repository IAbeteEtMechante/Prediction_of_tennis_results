in
monte
carlo
i
played
a
good
match
against
dimitrov
and
in
madrid
i
was
very
close
to
victory
i
know
what
to
do
to
beat
him
and
although
i
failed
last
week
i
hope
to
be
lucky
for
the
third
time
the
bulgarian
is
a
great
talent
who
can
play
well
on
any
surface
and
he
must
perform
at
the
highest
possible
level
to
reach
victory
i
think
i
have
everything
i
need
to
do
it
but
i
will
rely
a
lot
on
the
audience
in
rome
because
it
is
great
and
they
will
support
me
