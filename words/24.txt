hello
it
is
time
to
thank
mr
lyuben
dzhubrilov
for
his
personal
commitment
in
arranging
this
match
thanks
to
him
and
the
promotion
company
maxfight
things
happened
yes
i
think
i
m
already
the
recovery
process
took
me
a
long
time
but
fortunately
everything
is
behind
me
i
have
been
training
at
a
maximum
for
a
month
and
a
half
now
and
i
have
no
complaints
yes
i
watched
at
least
matches
of
salihov
and
i
dare
say
that
i
am
aware
of
his
style
it
is
very
sharp
in
stance
it
waits
and
is
not
fast
but
it
is
very
accurate
and
there
is
no
unnecessary
movement
i
think
we
are
very
similar
in
style
and
it
will
be
a
tactical
battle
i
am
preparing
some
surprises
for
him
i
am
already
driving
a
third
training
camp
first
i
helped
alexander
georgiev
in
his
preparation
for
maxfight
then
nikola
dipchikov
for
his
match
in
cage
of
glory
and
now
i
train
for
my
match
in
general
i
did
nt
have
much
time
from
the
proposal
to
the
date
of
the
match
but
i
m
in
preparation
with
the
boys
anyway
so
i
did
nt
think
about
it
at
all
i
train
with
my
coach
pepi
stoichkov
with
nikola
dipchikov
alexander
georgiev
yanko
borisov
tseco
ninov
and
others
i
also
go
to
ventzi
ivanov
in
his
boxing
club
winner
my
opponent
is
a
4time
world
champion
in
san
da
but
i
think
i
will
oppose
him
right
there
in
a
stand
i
have
a
limb
length
advantage
and
i
think
i
should
take
advantage
of
this
weapon
it
does
nt
scare
me
at
all
i
dare
say
that
i
have
a
very
good
protection
against
demolition
and
i
even
prefer
to
fight
with
grapples
because
they
are
very
predictable
for
me
and
my
style
is
quite
uncomfortable
for
them
he
s
excited
he
helps
me
with
everything
he
can
especially
with
preparing
the
right
food
for
me
which
makes
me
very
relieved
up
to
this
point
yes
i
think
the
future
is
known
only
to
god
so
we
ll
see
what
happens
next
i
train
twice
i
will
not
go
to
work
until
the
match
for
which
i
am
very
grateful
to
my
boss
i
get
up
coffee
and
a
workout
this
is
the
beginning
of
the
day
then
i
go
home
and
rest
a
second
workout
follows
after
which
i
only
have
the
strength
to
go
home
eat
and
lose
consciousness
in
bed
sunday
is
a
day
for
rest
massage
and
cinema
i
look
at
things
realistically
i
do
nt
throw
myself
away
now
i
have
only
the
m1
goal
in
front
of
me
i
get
up
and
go
to
bed
with
that
thought
m1
is
one
of
the
top
organizations
in
the
world
so
i
think
at
this
stage
i
need
to
nail
this
goal
then
i
ll
think
of
him
yes
in
the
world
no
here
people
think
of
us
as
neighborhood
thugs
and
morons
massively
we
must
be
to
blame
for
that
i
have
already
given
up
trying
to
prove
myself
to
the
people
here
i
try
not
to
read
or
think
about
the
public
comments
here
the
chance
to
prove
it
is
out
that
does
nt
mean
i
wo
nt
fight
in
maxfight
on
the
contrary
i
will
continue
with
full
force
i
want
the
belt
of
this
organization
no
definitely
it
is
very
difficult
in
this
regard
maxfight
tournaments
are
broadcast
on
national
television
i
ca
nt
understand
how
business
does
nt
see
a
potential
chance
for
advertising
in
us
fighters
for
tournaments
abroad
on
the
other
hand
it
is
impossible
people
obviously
do
nt
care
that
you
will
represent
the
country
somewhere
for
the
match
in
question
i
have
a
serious
russian
sponsor
a
huge
financial
institution
that
will
stand
behind
me
it
took
me
days
to
get
a
similar
sponsor
in
russia
although
i
am
not
russian
there
people
think
very
differently
there
is
respect
for
the
fighter
no
matter
he
wins
or
loses
there
i
dare
say
they
have
us
as
real
athletes
and
even
more
here
everyone
thinks
how
to
use
you
cheap
there
is
no
fighter
i
do
nt
want
to
fight
except
for
the
boys
from
my
close
circle
i
wish
you
health
it
may
be
a
clich√©
but
after
the
last
injury
i
can
say
that
now
i
understand
it
much
better
