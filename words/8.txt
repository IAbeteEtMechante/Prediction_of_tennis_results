i
look
forward
to
the
battle
with
kubrat
pulev
i
have
a
quiet
week
ahead
of
me
during
which
i
will
prepare
for
the
fight
we
will
also
visit
plovdiv
we
came
to
bulgaria
when
i
was
years
old
we
have
friends
here
in
sofia
i
expect
a
lot
of
audience
in
the
hall
but
i
do
nt
think
about
it
just
me
and
him
in
the
ring
and
that
s
all
i
care
about
the
fact
that
we
will
fight
on
its
territory
only
motivates
me
more
i
want
to
beat
him
more
my
advantage
is
that
pulev
has
never
fought
with
a
man
like
me
i
have
many
advantages
my
skills
mostly
you
will
all
see
what
i
am
talking
about
on
october

s
all
between
two
people
in
gloves
fighting
when
the
gong
strikes
we
will
see
who
is
better
only
my
father
and
i
work
in
training

did
nt
train
with
tyson

the
upcoming
fight
i
am
one
hundred
percent
sure
that
i
will
win
