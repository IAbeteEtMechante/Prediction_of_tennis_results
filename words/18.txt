the
match
is
knocking
on
the
door
the
preparation
is
going
hard
i
am
currently
in
the
sparring
week
the
emphasis
is
on
sparring
and
playing
with
a
partner
no
matter
how
well
prepared
i
am
for
fitness
i
will
play
boxing
that
s
why
i
m
completely
focused
tomorrow
is
my
last
sparring
and
i
can
say
that
i
feel
good
in
my
opinion
he
is
a
dangerous
enough
opponent
he
has
experience
and
he
will
try
to
do
the
best
for
himself
there
is
certainly
no
way
to
underestimate
a
person
who
has
entered
the
ring
i
guess
he
believes
in
himself
a
person
who
trusts
himself
should
not
be
underestimated
