and
the
greatest
tennis
players
in
the
world
happen
to
have
several
bad
games
a
year
the
bad
thing
was
that
it
all
happened
at
wimbledon
but
it
can
happen
to
anyone
in
individual
sports
now
however
i
do
not
expect
such
a
decline
in
my
game
i
am
calm
i
am
confident
in
my
qualities
everything
is
fine
and
there
is
simply
no
reason
to
be
worried
before
this
match
in
the
next
few
days
everything
will
be
fine
with
me
