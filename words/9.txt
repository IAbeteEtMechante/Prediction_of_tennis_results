my
last
match
was
about
two
months
ago
in
the
united
states
i
won
it
i
decided
to
go
back
and
compete
at
the
highest
level
again
so
i
chose
to
face
a
very
strong
and
dangerous
opponent
i
want
to
win
so
everything
is
fine
i
am
ready
to
defeat

enjoy
my
stay

looked
around
a
lot

tried
to
have
a
good
time

met
great
people

a
very
beautiful
place

enjoy
after
winning
my
next
match
i
have
faced
an
opponent
who
is
supported
by
the
fans
before
they
can
chant
in
his
favor
as
much
as
they
want
but
they
ca
nt
help
him
in
the
ring
there

only
two
of

in
the
ring

been
in
such
a
position
before

much
