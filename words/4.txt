i
was
pushed
to
places
i
had
never
been
pushed
before
i
think
i
have
more
fatigue
in
the
gym
than
during
the
fights
sometimes
i
try
things
that
do
nt
work
and
i
ve
broken
my
ribs
my
arm
i
ve
taken
out
my
shoulder
but
i
do
it
for
my
lofty
goals
i
trained
under
cover
of
darkness
so
i
could
shine
in
the
lights
