it
was
one
of
my
strongest
matches
in
australia
everything
in
my
game
worked
according
to
plan
from
the
first
minute
of
course
the
moment
is
difficult
for
luke
i
wish
him
all
the
best
until
the
end
of
the
season
he
has
the
qualities
to
be
a
top
player
for
him
today
s
match
was
the
first
semifinal
in
the
slam
i
am
sure
that
he
will
learn
lessons
and
continue
to
reap
success
in
the
future
the
final
with
rafa
i
would
buy
a
ticket
to
watch
this
match
i
say
it
if
anyone
is
still
hesitant
every
final
against
nadal
in
the
helmet
is
an
experience
that
will
be
remembered
for
a
lifetime
i
would
nt
play
my
son
a
recording
of
the
final
with
nadal
the
match
lasted
hours
and
minutes
because
i
do
nt
want
him
to
stay
in
front
of
the
tv
for
that
long
it
was
one
of
the
matches
that
changed
my
career
in
fact
we
always
make
great
matches
with
him
last
year
at
wimbledon
when
i
beat
him
in
the
fifth
set
it
was
amazing
this
match
allowed
me
to
regain
my
confidence
rafa
plays
impressively
he
has
not
lost
a
set
since
the
beginning
of
the
tournament
i
m
sure
we
ll
blow
up
the
court
i
can
promise
you
that
we
will
both
give
our
best
and
people
will
enjoy
our
game
on
sunday
i
will
face
my
biggest
opponent
in
the
final
of
a
grand
slam
tournament
what
more
could
i
want
