my
status
as
a
favorite
does
not
affect
me
i
have
almost
no
tension
but
boxing
is
a
sport
in
which
there
can
always
be
a
surprise
that
s
why
my
coach
and
i
talked
about
the
need
to
be
more
careful
in
the
first
rounds
i
think
i
m
well
prepared
we
still
do
nt
play
for
a
world
title
i
was
preparing
for
months
and
i
can
say
that
we
did
what
was
necessary
i
ca
nt
say
who
is
a
better
boxer
samuel
peter
or
kevin
johnson
both
are
good
but
johnson
is
better
prepared
