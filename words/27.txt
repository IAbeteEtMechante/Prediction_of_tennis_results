i
feel
in
shape
right
now
i
gained
matches
victories
and
quite
naturally
selfconfidence
my
successful
performance
in
the
united
states
may
be
due
to
the
fact
that
i
am
participating
in
fewer
tournaments
this
year
this
way
i
can
spend
more
time
preparing
it
s
great
that
my
parents
are
with
me
whenever
i
have
support
from
them
i
feel
better
and
more
motivated
on
the
court
in
addition
my
sister
elisaveta
and
i
met
in
los
angeles
so
it
was
a
real
family
reunion
i
know
caroline
s
game
well
yes
we
played
twice
and
i
have
two
losses
from
it
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
as
they
say
a
new
match
new
luck
i
hope
to
have
an
interesting
match
i
will
do
my
best
for
success
in
it
