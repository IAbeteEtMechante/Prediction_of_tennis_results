the
train
camp
was
almost
ov
i
on
had
on
mor
week
of
spar
left
when
i
got
in
the
ring
i
not
that
someth
was
wrong
then
i
tri
to
train
for
the
next
two
day
but
it
got
wors
and
wors
without
going
into
detail
it
was
a
bicep
injury
with
such
an
injury
unfortun
i
could
not
box
aft
furth
research
it
becam
clear
that
i
should
hav
week
off
such
thing
hap
in
sport
i
hav
seen
him
many
tim
and
with
oth
box
thi
hap
quit
oft
it
s
not
someth
you
can
control
it
just
hap
we
ar
in
a
sport
in
which
you
giv
yo
best
to
get
in
the
best
poss
shap
such
accid
thing
can
alway
hap
to
an
athlet
it
is
bad
not
on
for
me
but
also
for
my
oppon
who
was
also
in
a
period
of
prep
fortun
we
on
postpon
the
match
for
a
whil
but
i
see
posit
thing
as
wel
aft
that
kubr
pulev
as
he
himself
said
had
mor
tim
to
prep
which
mean
that
he
wil
be
in
bet
shap
for
the
match
than
he
would
hav
been
in
septemb
i
think
that
the
audy
wil
lik
pulev
with
his
perform
i
was
recov
for
four
week
and
the
injury
subsid
you
ca
nt
get
out
of
shap
in
week
then
i
slow
start
train
again
ye
it
was
a
bit
of
a
short
prep
but
i
believ
i
did
very
very
wel
the
prep
thi
tim
was
week
a
littl
short
than
the
prevy
on
but
the
goal
was
to
avoid
overtrain
the
worst
thing
in
sport
is
to
overtrain
no
i
am
healthy
the
doct
ass
me
i
hav
not
had
such
thought
and
i
alway
giv
myself
complet
we
did
the
sam
program
in
prep
as
bef
i
do
what
i
wil
win
the
match
with
i
m
fin
now
i
m
healthy
and
i
can
let
my
fist
fly
on
novemb
15th
in
the
first
phas
i
had
to
spar
partn
who
cam
and
went
my
guest
was
also
the
olymp
champ
anthony
joshu
i
was
impress
with
him
he
want
to
learn
a
lot
and
show
good
form
in
the
ring
kevin
johnson
was
also
at
the
camp
i
am
prep
for
a
riv
who
is
abov
al
very
selfconfid
i
believ
that
he
has
not
gain
so
much
expery
but
he
has
a
gre
desir
already
at
the
press
conf
in
jun
he
show
gre
selfconfid
he
doe
not
think
of
a
poss
loss
he
on
think
of
vict
in
the
rank
he
is
in
high
posit
he
has
fought
with
peopl
who
ar
tal
than
me
lik
dimitrenko
ustinov
and
oth
it
perform
wel
match
oft
end
bef
the
end
pulev
has
a
good
car
as
an
am
and
as
a
profess
he
has
not
lost
a
pro
match
in
the
ring
he
real
has
no
fear
or
worry
he
doe
not
know
what
it
is
and
has
nev
expery
it
he
has
good
techn
very
good
straight
shot
keep
the
dist
wel
it
s
hard
to
reach
that
s
what
hap
in
his
match
with
trav
walk
he
did
nt
los
his
lin
he
went
his
own
way
and
in
the
end
he
was
the
win
i
believ
he
know
he
should
not
underestim
the
champ
i
guess
what
tact
his
coach
cam
up
with
who
is
very
expery
and
has
a
lot
in
common
with
my
form
coach
fritz
zdunek
i
think
that
by
postpon
the
match
they
had
ev
mor
tim
to
analys
me
and
bet
prep
their
strategies
against
me
i
m
excit
to
see
what
hap
in
the
ring
i
ca
nt
prom
too
much
i
wil
do
what
i
can
if
the
match
end
quick
so
be
it
if
it
last
long
too
the
import
thing
is
to
continu
to
defend
my
titl
and
stay
success
in
the
ring
everyth
you
list
it
fit
him
ther
ar
som
thing
with
him
he
is
not
very
ment
tight
as
they
say
her
in
germany
becaus
of
his
behavy
and
act
he
doe
not
fit
into
the
fram
at
first
i
thought
it
was
fun
but
his
latest
perform
ar
not
very
funny
his
latest
video
doe
not
show
the
tru
he
took
a
boat
past
me
his
boy
tak
pict
of
me
i
knew
ther
would
be
a
provoc
but
it
was
nt
fun
when
i
fel
into
the
wat
it
was
dang
he
was
on
a
motorbo
and
i
was
in
the
wat
we
wer
not
on
eq
term
ye
thi
cross
the
bord
it
s
a
blow
below
the
belt
i
was
think
of
fil
a
form
complaint
becaus
som
thing
should
not
be
allow
it
could
quick
end
in
tragedy
yeah
al
that
sound
pretty
crap
to
me
look
lik
it
aint
for
me
eith
he
want
to
attract
at
by
attack
the
champ
i
lik
how
he
perform
against
vita
with
the
tear
of
his
shirt
and
the
whol
show
he
did
i
do
nt
understand
what
hap
to
him
at
on
tim
it
was
rum
that
al
thi
was
direct
but
if
that
s
the
cas
i
d
tak
my
broth
too
he
s
a
good
act
we
d
set
someth
up
i
ca
nt
talk
about
him
but
from
what
he
say
it
turn
out
that
he
wil
appear
he
know
exact
wher
i
am
and
when
i
wil
be
ther
but
i
do
nt
hav
a
problem
i
on
think
about
the
match
i
learn
that
you
hav
to
be
paty
ov

everyon
get
what
they
deserv
