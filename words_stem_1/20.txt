the
train
camp
wa
almost
over
i
onli
had
one
more
week
of
spar
left
when
i
got
in
the
ring
i
notic
that
someth
wa
wrong
then
i
tri
to
train
for
the
next
two
day
but
it
got
wors
and
wors
without
go
into
detail
it
wa
a
bicep
injuri
with
such
an
injuri
unfortun
i
could
not
box
after
further
research
it
becam
clear
that
i
should
have
week
off
such
thing
happen
in
sport
i
have
seen
him
mani
time
and
with
other
boxer
thi
happen
quit
often
it
s
not
someth
you
can
control
it
just
happen
we
are
in
a
sport
in
which
you
give
your
best
to
get
in
the
best
possibl
shape
such
accident
thing
can
alway
happen
to
an
athlet
it
is
bad
not
onli
for
me
but
also
for
my
oppon
who
wa
also
in
a
period
of
prepar
fortun
we
onli
postpon
the
match
for
a
while
but
i
see
posit
thing
as
well
after
that
kubrat
pulev
as
he
himself
said
had
more
time
to
prepar
which
mean
that
he
will
be
in
better
shape
for
the
match
than
he
would
have
been
in
septemb
i
think
that
the
audienc
will
like
pulev
with
hi
perform
i
wa
recov
for
four
week
and
the
injuri
subsid
you
ca
nt
get
out
of
shape
in
week
then
i
slowli
start
train
again
ye
it
wa
a
bit
of
a
short
prepar
but
i
believ
i
did
veri
veri
well
the
prepar
thi
time
wa
week
a
littl
shorter
than
the
previou
one
but
the
goal
wa
to
avoid
overtrain
the
worst
thing
in
sport
is
to
overtrain
no
i
am
healthi
the
doctor
assur
me
i
have
not
had
such
thought
and
i
alway
give
myself
complet
we
did
the
same
program
in
prepar
as
befor
i
do
what
i
will
win
the
match
with
i
m
fine
now
i
m
healthi
and
i
can
let
my
fist
fli
on
novemb
15th
in
the
first
phase
i
had
to
spar
partner
who
came
and
went
my
guest
wa
also
the
olymp
champion
anthoni
joshua
i
wa
impress
with
him
he
want
to
learn
a
lot
and
show
good
form
in
the
ring
kevin
johnson
wa
also
at
the
camp
i
am
prepar
for
a
rival
who
is
abov
all
veri
selfconfid
i
believ
that
he
ha
not
gain
so
much
experi
but
he
ha
a
great
desir
alreadi
at
the
press
confer
in
june
he
show
great
selfconfid
he
doe
not
think
of
a
possibl
loss
he
onli
think
of
victori
in
the
rank
he
is
in
high
posit
he
ha
fought
with
peopl
who
are
taller
than
me
like
dimitrenko
ustinov
and
other
it
perform
well
match
often
end
befor
the
end
pulev
ha
a
good
career
as
an
amateur
and
as
a
profession
he
ha
not
lost
a
pro
match
in
the
ring
he
realli
ha
no
fear
or
worri
he
doe
not
know
what
it
is
and
ha
never
experienc
it
he
ha
good
techniqu
veri
good
straight
shot
keep
the
distanc
well
it
s
hard
to
reach
that
s
what
happen
in
hi
match
with
travi
walker
he
did
nt
lose
hi
line
he
went
hi
own
way
and
in
the
end
he
wa
the
winner
i
believ
he
know
he
should
not
underestim
the
champion
i
guess
what
tactic
hi
coach
came
up
with
who
is
veri
experienc
and
ha
a
lot
in
common
with
my
former
coach
fritz
zdunek
i
think
that
by
postpon
the
match
they
had
even
more
time
to
analyz
me
and
better
prepar
their
strategi
against
me
i
m
excit
to
see
what
happen
in
the
ring
i
ca
nt
promis
too
much
i
will
do
what
i
can
if
the
match
end
quickli
so
be
it
if
it
last
longer
too
the
import
thing
is
to
continu
to
defend
my
titl
and
stay
success
in
the
ring
everyth
you
list
it
fit
him
there
are
some
thing
with
him
he
is
not
veri
mental
tight
as
they
say
here
in
germani
becaus
of
hi
behavior
and
action
he
doe
not
fit
into
the
frame
at
first
i
thought
it
wa
fun
but
hi
latest
perform
are
not
veri
funni
hi
latest
video
doe
not
show
the
truth
he
took
a
boat
past
me
hi
boy
take
pictur
of
me
i
knew
there
would
be
a
provoc
but
it
wa
nt
fun
when
i
fell
into
the
water
it
wa
danger
he
wa
on
a
motorboat
and
i
wa
in
the
water
we
were
not
on
equal
term
ye
thi
cross
the
border
it
s
a
blow
below
the
belt
i
wa
think
of
file
a
formal
complaint
becaus
some
thing
should
not
be
allow
it
could
quickli
end
in
tragedi
yeah
al
that
sound
pretti
crap
to
me
look
like
it
aint
for
me
either
he
want
to
attract
attent
by
attack
the
champion
i
like
how
he
perform
against
vitali
with
the
tear
of
hi
shirt
and
the
whole
show
he
did
i
do
nt
understand
what
happen
to
him
at
one
time
it
wa
rumor
that
all
thi
wa
direct
but
if
that
s
the
case
i
d
take
my
brother
too
he
s
a
good
actor
we
d
set
someth
up
i
ca
nt
talk
about
him
but
from
what
he
say
it
turn
out
that
he
will
appear
he
know
exactli
where
i
am
and
when
i
will
be
there
but
i
do
nt
have
a
problem
i
onli
think
about
the
match
i
learn
that
you
have
to
be
patient
over
time
everyon
get
what
they
deserv
some
peopl
go
in
one
direct
from
which
i
return
over
time
there
were
mani
boxer
who
were
wrong
derek
chizora
for
exampl
had
the
same
mental
health
problem
as
brigg
slap
my
brother
he
freak
out
at
a
press
confer
threw
a
bottl
at
david
hay
and
wa
knock
out
the
next
game
there
is
an
express
fate
is
a
bitch
everyon
get
what
they
deserv
and
the
same
goe
for
box
i
am
patient
with
him
i
can
offer
him
a
match
if
he
continu
to
develop
in
the
ring
i
see
that
he
is
alreadi
in
the
top
he
ha
a
north
american
titl
so
he
may
end
up
in
a
posit
to
come
out
against
me

i
decid
to
meet
