everyth
is
as
it

and

a
contend
of
cours
it
s
good
to
know
that
you

just
a
step
away
from
a
match
with
klitschko
howev
i
am
not
think
about
thi
at
the
moment
but
about
the
upcom
meet
thi
is
the
most
import
thing
now
to
concentr
as
much
as
possibl
and
we
will
talk
about
the
match
with
klitschko
when
the
time
come
ye
there
are
mani
match
on
the
internet
i
watch
him
he
is
undoubtedli
a
good
and
extrem
experienc
boxer
howev
i
think
i
will
beat
him
i
do
not
believ
thi
will
have
much
effect
on
the
other
hand
he
will
appear
in
our
game
more
play
while
i
have
not
been
in
the
ring
for
almost
a
year
it
seem
to
me
that
the
chanc
are
equal
no
on
the
contrari
at
the
moment
i
feel
veri
good
rest
fresh
i
train
