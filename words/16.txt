i
do
nt
think
i
m
an
outsider
in
this
match
i
am
very
happy
when
someone
underestimates
me
this
gives
me
more
advantage
and
additional
motivation
i
emphasized
because
this
is
an
important
issue
for
me
i
believe
that
in
sports
the
rules
must
be
the
same
for
everyone
in
order
for
it
to
be
an
honest
and
real
sport
that
s
why
i
want
klitschko
to
pass
the
same
doping
tests
it
is
not
correct
for
the
contender
to
be
checked
at
any
time
and
in
any
place
and
for
the
world
champion
to
be
checked
only
after
the
match
even
the
kids
know
that
whatever
he
takes
can
be
cleared
for
the
match
personally
if
i
were
a
world
champion
i
would
give
such
a
test
to
clear
my
name
and
to
prove
to
people
that
i
am
clean
and
have
nothing
to
hide
i
think
that
should
be
the
reaction
of
a
real
world
champion
and
not
to
hide
and
get
away
in
any
possible
way
which
definitely
proves
that
his
job
is
not
clean
and
he
has
worries
klitschko
escapes
with
excuses
that
his
contract
was
signed
in
another
way
to
prove
it
he
could
do
a
doping
test
of
his
own
accord
not
to
mention
that
at
one
olympics
his
brother
vitali
klitschko
was
caught
with
banned
substances
and
deprived
of
competition
rights
for
some
time
especially
on
this
topic
things
are
very
simple
either
he
is
under
doping
control
as
i
am
proving
that
he
really
is
a
world
champion
or
he
is
not
being
subjected
and
proving
that
he
is
most
likely
using
banned
stimulants
which
is
due
to
his
long
standing
at
the
top
not
because
he
is
the
best
for
me
the
bigger
opponents
are
somewhat
comfortable
and
i
hope
he
is
comfortable
too
this
match
for
me
is
a
match
for
a
world
title
which
is
my
dream
i
prepare
like
any
other
opponent
i
do
nt
care
what
he
s
like
as
a
person
i
do
nt
like
men
and
he
will
hardly
ever
be
a
close
friend
of
mine
to
me
he
s
just
an
opponent
i
do
nt
hate
anyone
and
i
have
nt
hated
any
of
my
opponents
so
far
yes
for
sure
with
god
s
help
i
feel
great
the
training
process
is
going
according
to
plan
and
on
september
i
will
be
in
great
shape
i
will
be
a
boxing
machine
boxing
is
a
sport
in
which
you
can
never
predict
something
our
chances
are
to
the
match
will
be
extremely
interesting
and
i
will
win
