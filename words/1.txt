everyone
underestimates
me
but
it
will
be
a
terrible
battle
everyone
will
see
what
i
can
do
i
am
here
to
shock
everyone
to
shock
the
world
and
to
show
who
i
am
i
m
ready
for
anthony
joshua
i
hope
he
underestimates
me
and
thinks
the
battle
with
me
will
be
a
bean
job
but
when
he
faces
me
in
the
ring
he
ll
know
that
s
not
going
to
be
the
case
when
you
see
my
speed
and
accuracy
you
will
be
surprised
i
have
seen
many
weaknesses
in
his
game
and
i
know
that
he
is
working
on
them
the
most
important
thing
is
to
stick
to
my
game
plan
i
do
nt
want
to
talk
too
much
about
his
weaknesses
i
just
have
to
improvise
and
take
advantage
of
them
when
the
gong
strikes
we
watch
a
lot
of
videos
of
mike
tyson
we
re
working
on
some
of
his
movements
so
i
can
get
closer
to
anthony
joshua
the
most
important
thing
is
to
stay
focused
and
prepared
to
be
ready
for
everything
and
to
be
in
shape
