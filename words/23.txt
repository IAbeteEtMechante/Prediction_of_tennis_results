two
days
ago
i
had
an
unpleasant
accident
on
the
struma
highway
i
have
the
honor
to
train
with
the
best
coach
thanks
for
the
help
of
the
other
guys
who
help
me
in
training
even
in
football
i
have
never
underestimated
the
opponent
so
it
will
be
on
saturday
although
i
wanted
to
have
a
slightly
tougher
opponent
if
i
lose
to
nasko
on
saturday
my
selfesteem
will
collapse
i
believe
in
myself
and
i
believe
that
i
will
be
able
to
win
i
do
not
underestimate
it
in
any
way
