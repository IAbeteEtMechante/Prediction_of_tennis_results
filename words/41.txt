the
feeling
is
good
i
feel
like
i
generally
played
good
tennis
i
demonstrated
a
decent
level
the
second
set
was
not
easy
i
lost
with
a
breakthrough
and
fabiano
served
to
win
the
set
from
that
moment
on
i
pressed
the
accelerator
and
started
to
play
more
aggressively
my
returns
have
also
improved
the
third
set
was
great
for
me
towards
the
end
of
the
match
i
was
playing
very
strong
tennis
well
i
d
love
to
do
it
but
there
are
many
other
guys
here
for
the
same
purpose
for
now
i
m
driving
step
by
step
while
trying
to
play
my
best
i
want
to
keep
concentrating
and
try
to
raise
my
game
to
a
higher
level
for
the
next
game
let
s
hope
it
works
out
for
me
in
the
coming
weeks
