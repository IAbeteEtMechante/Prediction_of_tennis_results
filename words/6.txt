grigor
is
a
serious
opponent
i
m
sure
he
s
preparing
well
i
have
no
intention
of
underestimating
it
i
have
something
to
show
against
him
i
took
a
break
after
my
last
game
at
the
end
of
there
were
holidays
but
now
i
have
increased
the
training
load
i
will
be
fresher
i
train
in
pleven
in
the
sports
club
scorpio
there
are
a
lot
of
guys
there
with
whom
i
do
sparring
grigor
is
experienced
and
has
a
lot
of
matches
there
is
no
specific
style
of
play
he
is
able
to
press
or
play
the
long
pause
has
an
effect
but
he
knows
how
to
get
back
in
shape
you
do
nt
perform
well
in
arena
armeec
but
sometimes
in
boxing
you
get
hit
there
will
be
a
show
anything
is
possible
in
this
battle
i
have
no
intention
of
making
threats
because
sport
has
taught
me
to
respect
my
opponents
