i
am
friends
with
children
rather
than
strict
authority
if
you
do
nt
share
their
flame
and
do
nt
flicker
on
a
fun
frequency
you
ca
nt
have
a
dialogue
and
things
will
happen
mixed
martial
arts
are
a
complex
sport
and
require
a
lot
of
work
in
every
aspect
of
the
game
standing
on
the
ground
to
be
good
you
need
perseverance
and
perseverance
in
bulgaria
it
is
very
difficult
for
women
to
develop
in
this
sport
simply
because
we
are
too
few
our
only
chance
is
to
look
for
appearances
abroad
but
most
foreign
chains
are
looking
for
them
one
or
two
weeks
before
the
match
and
it
is
very
difficult
for
such
a
short
period
to
get
into
active
racing
form
the
meeting
on
august
will
not
be
easy
and
the
preparation
is
going
great
with
training
twice
a
day
circuit
training
cross
country
sprints
sparring
we
are
working
on
a
strategy
against
the
opponent
