great
i
feel
welcome
to
romania
and
to
my
hall
before
kubrat
beat
me
on
points
it
is
normal
to
have
a
rematch
now
and
that
is
good
for
me
i
was
very
young
only
he
had
more
experience
i
think
we
are
equal
now
i
strongly
believe
in
myself
and
i
prepared
very
well
i
want
revenge
i
want
to
be
the
best
i
know
him
better
as
an
athlete
i
know
that
it
is
very
popular
in
bulgaria
i
think
he
s
cool
as
a
person
i
have
only
one
loss
now
i
want
to
be
on
top
i
am
happy
that
i
have
a
chance
to
box
with
kubrat
pulev
i
want
to
beat
him
two
years
ago
i
decided
to
make
my
own
boxing
hall
where
i
would
not
depend
on
anyone
i
like
to
pass
on
my
experience
to
the
children
i
believe
that
the
experience
must
be
passed
on
i
like
mohamed
ali
i
read
a
lot
about
him
i
like
the
way
he
boxed
i
put
inspirational
quotes
from
him
in
the
hall
that
motivates
me
my
work
in
the
special
units
helps
me
to
be
motivated
and
not
to
give
up
i
need
this
adrenaline
i
m
used
to
it
i
am
alert
and
there
is
no
room
for
fear
there
are
risks
in
everything
even
walking
down
the
street
when
you
do
something
with
great
desire
and
passion
the
risks
stay
in
the
background
boxing
is
my
biggest
hobby
otherwise
in
winter
i
like
to
ski
i
m
crazy
about
pancakes
my
dream
is
to
bring
a
belt
from
the
world
cup
in
romania
the
first
heavyweight
belt
