i
ca
nt
say
that
i
have
regained
my
shape
that
s
not
the
case
i
just
started
well
this
is
my
first
match
in
almost
a
year
on
this
surface
i
ca
nt
pretend
i
m
not
in
any
pain
the
important
thing
is
that
i
managed
to
move
well
on
the
court
and
i
was
confident
in
the
things
i
was
doing
against
agut
there
will
be
another
good
test
against
dimitrov
so
we
ll
see
i
have
to
play
well
again
i
need
to
play
matches
spend
more
time
on
the
court
and
of
course
victories
help
every
victory
brings
positive
energy
confidence
in
the
game
and
the
capabilities
of
the
body
and
that
s
what
i
need
now
