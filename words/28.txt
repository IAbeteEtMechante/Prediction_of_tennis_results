recently
grigor
and
i
often
play
against
each
other
and
train
together
especially
on
clay
we
know
each
other
well
he
is
always
a
very
tough
opponent
he
is
very
well
physically
moves
very
well
on
the
court
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
overcome
on
clay
i
do
nt
think
we
ve
played
before
it
will
be
for
the
first
match
this
is
a
quarterfinal
whatever
happens
we
will
then
have
to
play
in
pairs
together
and
there
will
be
no
problem
