everyth
is
behind

month
and
a
half
now
and
i
have
no
complaint
ye
i

at
least
match
of
salihov

i
dare
say
that
i
am
awar
of
hi
style
it
is
veri
sharp
in
stanc
it
wait
and
is
not
fast
but
it
is
veri
accur
and
there
is
no
unnecessari
movement
i
think
we
are
veri
similar
in
style
and
it
will
be
a
tactic
battl
i
am
prepar
some
surpris
for
him
i

say
that
i
have
a
veri
good
protect
against

i
even
prefer
to
fight
with

becaus
they
are
veri
predict
for
me
and
my
style
is
quit
uncomfort
for
them
he
s
excit
he
help
me
with
everyth
he
can
especi
with
prepar
the
right
food
for
me

make
me
veri
reliev

begin
of

one
of
the
top
organ
in
the
world
so
i
think
at
thi
stage
i
need
to
nail
thi
goal
then
i
ll
think
of
him
ye
in
the
world
no
here
peopl
think
of
us
as
neighborhood
thug
and
moron
massiv
we
must
be
to
blame
for
that
i
have
alreadi
given
up
tri
to
prove
myself
to
the
peopl
here
i
tri
not
to
read
or
think
about
the
public
comment
here
the
chanc
to
prove
it
is
out
that
doe
nt
mean
i
wo
nt
fight
in
maxfight
on
the
contrari
i
will
continu
with
full
forc
i
want
the
belt
of
thi
organ
no
definit
it
is
veri
difficult
in
thi
regard
maxfight
tournament
are
broadcast
on
nation
televis
i
ca
nt
understand
how
busi
doe
nt
see
a
potenti
chanc
for
advertis
in
us
fighter
for
tournament
abroad
on
the
other
hand
it
is
imposs
peopl
obvious
do
nt
care
that
you
will
repres
the
countri
somewher
for
the
match
in
question
i
have
a
seriou
russian
sponsor
a
huge
financi
institut
that
will
stand
behind
me
it
took
me
day
to
get
a
similar
sponsor
in
russia
although
i
am
not
russian
there
peopl
think
veri
differ
there
is
respect
for
the
fighter
no
matter
he
win
or
lose
there
i
dare
say
they
have
us
as
real
athlet
and
even
more
here
everyon
think
how
to
use
you
cheap
there
is
no
fighter

do
nt
want
to
fight
except
for
the
boy
from
my
close
circl
i
wish
you
health

may
be
a
clich√©
but
after
the
last
injuri
i
can
say
that
now
i
understand
it
much
better
