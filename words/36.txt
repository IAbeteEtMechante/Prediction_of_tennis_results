i
ca
nt
judge
whether
dudi
sela
was
injured
at
the
beginning
of
the
match
i
tried
to
be
completely
focused
and
show
my
game
after
the
first
set
i
felt
very
confident
and
followed
my
plan
then
sella
called
the
physiotherapist
and
i
just
had
to
keep
playing
the
same
way
as
in
the
first
set
federer
is
a
great
grass
player
roger
has
proven
himself
at
wimbledon
more
than
once
or
twice
we
all
know
what
to
expect
from
him
let
s
see
who
wins
and
then
i
will
think
about
what
lies
ahead
honestly
the
feeling
of
going
through
the
first
week
of
wimbledon
is
special
and
makes
me
smile
being
in
the
second
week
of
a
grand
slam
tournament
is
a
small
achievement
for
any
player
i
appreciate
it
but
i
m
far
from
done
