he
ca
nt
help
but
score
every
ball
on
the
court
in
a
clay
match
sometimes
this
can
happen
on
a
very
fast
court
he
may
suffer
a
little
more
if
you
are
able
to
press
him
and
put
him
under
pressure
all
the
time
however
you
ca
nt
imagine
how
this
would
happen
so
i
have
to
find
a
solution
team
plays
great
he
last
won
in
barcelona
and
before
that
in
indian
wells
i
saw
what
i
could
do
on
slower
hard
courts
not
that
i
wanted
to
prove
it
but
i
still
think
that
beating
rafa
in
barcelona
is
an
achievement
however
i
still
think
that
rafa
is
the
unit
of
measurement
of
glue
not
dominic
but
we
will
see
what
happens
