well
yes
we
are
glad
that
things
are
already
officially
regulated
there
were
a
lot
of
problems
with
finding
a
rival
but
now
everything
is
as
it
should
be
and
we
have
the
confidence
that
the
winner
will
actually
be
declared
a
contender
of
course
it
s
good
to
know
that
you
re
just
a
step
away
from
a
match
with
klitschko
however
i
am
not
thinking
about
this
at
the
moment
but
about
the
upcoming
meeting
this
is
the
most
important
thing
now
to
concentrate
as
much
as
possible
and
we
will
talk
about
the
match
with
klitschko
when
the
time
comes
yes
there
are
many
matches
on
the
internet
i
watched
him
he
is
undoubtedly
a
good
and
extremely
experienced
boxer
however
i
think
i
will
beat
him
i
do
not
believe
this
will
have
much
effect
on
the
other
hand
he
will
appear
in
our
game
more
played
while
i
have
not
been
in
the
ring
for
almost
a
year
it
seems
to
me
that
the
chances
are
equal
no
on
the
contrary
at
the
moment
i
feel
very
good
rested
fresh
i
train
well
and
i
hope
this
will
be
evident
in
the
match
in
general
everything
has
its
advantages
and
disadvantages
i
have
nt
stopped
training
but
in
recent
weeks
we
have
significantly
increased
our
speed
now
i
have
more
sparring
ahead
of
me
and
in
a
day
or
two
a
russian
and
an
american
should
come
i
expect
the
bulgarian
boxer
dimitar
stoimenov
to
arrive
who
has
a
back
guard
like
thompson
i
think
working
with
him
will
be
very
useful
for
me
i
also
have
german
sparring
partners
with
whom
we
already
train
certainly
my
closest
friends
will
be
by
the
ring
i
hope
there
will
be
more
bulgarians
in
the
hall
