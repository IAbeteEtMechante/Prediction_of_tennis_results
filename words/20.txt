the
training
camp
was
almost
over
i
only
had
one
more
week
of
sparring
left
when
i
got
in
the
ring
i
noticed
that
something
was
wrong
then
i
tried
to
train
for
the
next
two
days
but
it
got
worse
and
worse
without
going
into
details
it
was
a
biceps
injury
with
such
an
injury
unfortunately
i
could
not
box
after
further
research
it
became
clear
that
i
should
have
weeks
off
such
things
happen
in
sports
i
have
seen
him
many
times
and
with
other
boxers
this
happens
quite
often
it
s
not
something
you
can
control
it
just
happens
we
are
in
a
sport
in
which
you
give
your
best
to
get
in
the
best
possible
shape
such
accidental
things
can
always
happen
to
an
athlete
it
is
bad
not
only
for
me
but
also
for
my
opponent
who
was
also
in
a
period
of
preparation
fortunately
we
only
postponed
the
match
for
a
while
but
i
see
positive
things
as
well
after
that
kubrat
pulev
as
he
himself
said
had
more
time
to
prepare
which
means
that
he
will
be
in
better
shape
for
the
match
than
he
would
have
been
in
september
i
think
that
the
audience
will
like
pulev
with
his
performance
i
was
recovering
for
four
weeks
and
the
injury
subsided
you
ca
nt
get
out
of
shape
in
weeks
then
i
slowly
started
training
again
yes
it
was
a
bit
of
a
short
preparation
but
i
believe
i
did
very
very
well
the
preparation
this
time
was
weeks
a
little
shorter
than
the
previous
one
but
the
goal
was
to
avoid
overtraining
the
worst
thing
in
sports
is
to
overtrain
no
i
am
healthy
the
doctors
assured
me
i
have
not
had
such
thoughts
and
i
always
give
myself
completely
we
did
the
same
program
in
preparation
as
before
i
do
what
i
will
win
the
match
with
i
m
fine
now
i
m
healthy
and
i
can
let
my
fists
fly
on
november
15th
in
the
first
phase
i
had
to
sparring
partners
who
came
and
went
my
guest
was
also
the
olympic
champion
anthony
joshua
i
was
impressed
with
him
he
wanted
to
learn
a
lot
and
showed
good
form
in
the
ring
kevin
johnson
was
also
at
the
camp
i
am
preparing
for
a
rival
who
is
above
all
very
selfconfident
i
believe
that
he
has
not
gained
so
much
experience
but
he
has
a
great
desire
already
at
the
press
conference
in
june
he
showed
great
selfconfidence
he
does
not
think
of
a
possible
loss
he
only
thinks
of
victory
in
the
rankings
he
is
in
high
positions
he
has
fought
with
people
who
are
taller
than
me
like
dimitrenko
ustinov
and
others
it
performs
well
matches
often
end
before
the
end
pulev
has
a
good
career
as
an
amateur
and
as
a
professional
he
has
not
lost
a
pro
match
in
the
ring
he
really
has
no
fears
or
worries
he
does
not
know
what
it
is
and
has
never
experienced
it
he
has
good
technique
very
good
straight
shot
keep
the
distance
well
it
s
hard
to
reach
that
s
what
happened
in
his
match
with
travis
walker
he
did
nt
lose
his
line
he
went
his
own
way
and
in
the
end
he
was
the
winner
i
believe
he
knows
he
should
not
underestimate
the
champion
i
guess
what
tactics
his
coach
came
up
with
who
is
very
experienced
and
has
a
lot
in
common
with
my
former
coach
fritz
zdunek
i
think
that
by
postponing
the
match
they
had
even
more
time
to
analyze
me
and
better
prepare
their
strategies
against
me
i
m
excited
to
see
what
happens
in
the
ring
i
ca
nt
promise
too
much
i
will
do
what
i
can
if
the
match
ends
quickly
so
be
it
if
it
lasts
longer
too
the
important
thing
is
to
continue
to
defend
my
title
and
stay
successful
in
the
ring
everything
you
listed
it
fits
him
there
are
some
things
with
him
he
is
not
very
mentally
tight
as
they
say
here
in
germany
because
of
his
behavior
and
actions
he
does
not
fit
into
the
frame
at
first
i
thought
it
was
fun
but
his
latest
performances
are
not
very
funny
his
latest
video
does
not
show
the
truth
he
took
a
boat
past
me
his
boys
taking
pictures
of
me
i
knew
there
would
be
a
provocation
but
it
was
nt
fun
when
i
fell
into
the
water
it
was
dangerous
he
was
on
a
motorboat
and
i
was
in
the
water
we
were
not
on
equal
terms
yes
this
crosses
the
border
it
s
a
blow
below
the
belt
i
was
thinking
of
filing
a
formal
complaint
because
some
things
should
not
be
allowed
it
could
quickly
end
in
tragedy
yeah
al
that
sounds
pretty
crap
to
me
looks
like
it
aint
for
me
either
he
wants
to
attract
attention
by
attacking
the
champion
i
liked
how
he
performed
against
vitaly
with
the
tear
of
his
shirt
and
the
whole
show
he
did
i
do
nt
understand
what
happened
to
him
at
one
time
it
was
rumored
that
all
this
was
directed
but
if
that
s
the
case
i
d
take
my
brother
too
he
s
a
good
actor
we
d
set
something
up
i
ca
nt
talk
about
him
but
from
what
he
says
it
turns
out
that
he
will
appear
he
knows
exactly
where
i
am
and
when
i
will
be
there
but
i
do
nt
have
a
problem
i
only
think
about
the
match
i
learned
that
you
have
to
be
patient
over
time
everyone
gets
what
they
deserve
some
people
go
in
one
direction
from
which
i
return
over
time
there
were
many
boxers
who
were
wrong
derek
chizora
for
example
had
the
same
mental
health
problems
as
briggs
slapping
my
brother
he
freaked
out
at
a
press
conference
threw
a
bottle
at
david
haye
and
was
knocked
out
the
next
game
there
is
an
expression
fate
is
a
bitch
everyone
gets
what
they
deserve
and
the
same
goes
for
boxing
i
am
patient
with
him
i
can
offer
him
a
match
if
he
continues
to
develop
in
the
ring
i
see
that
he
is
already
in
the
top
he
has
a
north
american
title
so
he
may
end
up
in
a
position
to
come
out
against
me
maybe
i
decide
to
meet
